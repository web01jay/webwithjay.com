# Manual Test for Redirect Logic Implementation

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Redirect to Intended Destination
1. **Setup**: User is not authenticated
2. **Action**: User tries to access `/clients` directly
3. **Expected**: 
   - User is redirected to `/login`
   - Intended destination `/clients` is stored in localStorage
4. **Action**: User logs in successfully
5. **Expected**: 
   - User is redirected to `/clients` (the intended destination)
   - Intended destination is cleared from localStorage

### Scenario 2: Redirect to Dashboard (No Intended Destination)
1. **Setup**: User is not authenticated
2. **Action**: User navigates to `/login` directly
3. **Expected**: Login form is displayed
4. **Action**: User logs in successfully
5. **Expected**: User is redirected to `/dashboard` (default)

### Scenario 3: Redirect to Dashboard (Public Route as Intended Destination)
1. **Setup**: User is not authenticated, intended destination is set to `/login`
2. **Action**: User logs in successfully
3. **Expected**: 
   - User is redirected to `/dashboard` instead of `/login`
   - Intended destination is cleared from localStorage

### Scenario 4: Authenticated User Accessing Public Routes
1. **Setup**: User is authenticated
2. **Action**: User tries to access `/login` or `/signup`
3. **Expected**: User is redirected to `/dashboard` or their intended destination

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`bill-front-end/src/pages/Login.jsx`**:
   - Added post-login redirect logic
   - Handles intended destination retrieval and clearing
   - Prevents redirect to public routes as intended destinations

2. **`bill-front-end/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`**:
   - Already had intended destination management (no changes needed)

3. **`bill-front-end/src/components/RouteGuards.jsx`**:
   - Already had intended destination logic (no changes needed)

### Key Functions:
- `getIntendedDestination()`: Retrieves stored intended destination
- `clearIntendedDestination()`: Clears stored intended destination
- `setIntendedDestination(path)`: Stores intended destination (used by PrivateRoute)

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Public routes (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/home`) are not used as intended destinations
- Login failures do not trigger redirects
- Intended destination is cleared after successful use
- Default redirect to `/dashboard` when no intended destination exists

## Test Results:
✅ All unit tests passing for redirect logic
✅ RouteGuards tests passing
✅ AuthContext tests passing
✅ Login component tests passing with new redirect functionality
